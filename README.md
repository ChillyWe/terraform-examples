## Overview

The aim of this repository is to provide simple, modular Terraform examples to help with learning and exploring the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) paradigm. By working through these examples, users will gain a deeper understanding of Terraformâ€™s core concepts and its practical applications in cloud infrastructure.

## Projects

Each project is stored in its own directory within this repository:

1. **create-aws-sandbox-account**:
   - **Description**: A basic configuration to create an AWS sandbox account.
   
2. **learn-terraform-docker-container**:
   - **Description**: Deploys a simple Docker container to get familiar with using Terraform for containerized applications.

3. **learn-terraform-aws-instance**:
   - **Description**: Launches a single AWS EC2 instance, covering basic AWS instance provisioning via Terraform.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use the examples in this repository, you'll need:
- **Terraform**: Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) (version 1.0 or later).
- **AWS CLI**: If working with AWS projects, install and configure the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
- **Docker**: Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) if you are working on the Docker example.

### Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine to get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChillyWe/terraform-examples.git
cd terraform-examples
```

### Usage

Each project is independent and can be run separately. Follow these general steps:

Navigate to the project directory:
``` bash

cd create-aws-sandbox-account  # or choose another project directory
```

Initialize the Terraform configuration:
```bash
terraform init
```

Plan the deployment to review changes:
```bash
terraform plan
```

Apply the configuration to deploy resources:
```bash
terraform apply
```

Destroy resources after testing:
```bash
terraform destroy
```
    
>Note: Be sure to adjust any variables in the main.tf file if needed, or provide them as input during terraform apply.
